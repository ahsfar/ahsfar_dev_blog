Testing 
Uh ðŸ˜µ... Now can you imagine what it'd look like if we made an update to the game to add 5, 10 or 15 new animals? ðŸ¤•

This simply doesn't scale.

# Best of both worlds

How cool would it be to have something like the following:

```ts
type Animal = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
} & OneOf<{
  dog: Dog;
  wolf: Wolf;
  eagle: Eagle;
  mouse: Mouse;
}>;

interface Player {
  // ... same ...
}
```
